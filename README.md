## Processing Time Experiment

To run this program simply download both the `Processing_Time_Exp.py` along with the provided Asteroid_Database folder, and run in any Interactive Development Environment

*Note: The Meshgrid is initially set to the maximum of 10,000 & all the CPU cores will be used!! This can be modified below the '__main__' definition*

### Dont have tensorflow-gpu?
regular TensorFlow leverages the CPU for calculations, you MUST use tensrflow-gpu, and select a supported Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
